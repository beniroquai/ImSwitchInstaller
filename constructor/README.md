ImSwitch Installer 
=================

Here we install a local miniconda environment and do all the heavy load of installing imswitch in the `setup.py` file. This includes UAC-controlled installation of drivers. 
A more in-depth documentation will follow. 

Finally, to create a Miniconda installer, you simply run (in this directory):
```
    $ cd constructor .
    $ constructor .
```
